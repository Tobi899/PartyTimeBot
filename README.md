# PartyTimeBot
A very basic custom Discord bot for a music Discord server.

__Needs .env file or environment variables with these keys:__
```text
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
DISCORD_ADMIN_ID=your-discord-id (for changing the bot prefix)
BOT_PREFIX=>>
SNOOZE_ROLE_ID=role-id
UOS_ROLE_ID=role-id 
```

Feel free to do with this whatever you want.
