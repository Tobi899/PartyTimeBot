# PartyTimeBot
A very basic Discord bot which mainly features a normal countdown and a bar chart style countdown.

__Needs .env file or environment variables with these keys:__
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
DISCORD_ADMIN_ID=your-discord-id (for changing the bot prefix)

```
Feel free to do with this whatever you want.
